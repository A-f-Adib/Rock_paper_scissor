<h3> Description</h3> <br>

In this SwiftUI project i built a rock,paper,scissor game that gives users nice gaming view and experience. its a refreshing game.

This project is nice and easy, it gives me chance to get introduced to whole range of new SwiftUI functionality: stacks, buttons, images, alerts, asset catalogs, and more.

 this app used a completely standard iOS look and feel, here i made something more customized with SwiftUI so anyone can easily play the game.
